## Internet of Things
Here's a simple reference model for Internet of Things (IoT) applications:

<img src="iot.jpg" width="540"/>

For a general introduction to IoT, see [this presentation](http://www.tamberg.org/fhnw/2019/hs/IoT01Introduction.pdf).

## Device
A device contains a microcontroller, connectivity and sensors or actuators.

To create a custom device, read the [#MakeZurich hardware intro](https://github.com/make-zurich/makezurich-hardware-intro).

## Connectivity
Connectivity options include [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy/introduction) (BLE) and [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan).

[The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) (TTN) is a global, open LoRaWAN infrastructure.

## Gateway
A gateway forwards data from a device to the backend and vice versa.

### The Things Network LoRaWAN gateway
In Zürich [there are plenty of TTN LoRaWAN gateways](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/community/zurich/) already.

To check if there's network coverage, use the [TTN mapper](https://ttnmapper.org/).

You can also [build](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1665467) or buy a [indoor](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/thethingsindoor/) or [outdoor](https://www.lorixone.io/) gateway.

### Raspberry Pi as a BLE gateway
See [this tutorial](http://www.tamberg.org/fhnw/2019/hs/IoT06RaspberryPiGateway.pdf) based on the [Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/).

## Backend
The backend server provides a service endpoint in the cloud.

Devices send data to the backend, or receive commands.

Clients get data from the backend, or send commands.

### The Things Network LoRaWAN backend
> Crash course: [LoRaWAN and TTN](https://makezurich.ch/#workshop-lorawan), October <s>26</s>28, 7pm at Bitwäscherei.

The TTN LoRaWAN backend provides access to data sent by your devices, here's a [system overview](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/).

To send data, [sign up for a TTN account](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/register), open the [EU](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/) or [Swiss console](https://console.ttn.opennetworkinfrastructure.org/), create an app and add your device.

The TTN LoRaWAN backend provides [integrations](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/integrations.html) with 3rd-party services, an [HTTP API](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/http/) and a [MQTT API](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/mqtt/api.html).

### Building applications with TTN
Here there is a [general overview of how to build applications with TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/options.html), including different SDKs and other integration options.

### Using the ThingSpeak integration to store data from TTN
The TTN LoRaWAN backend provides an integration with ThingSpeak, check [this tutorial](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/thingspeak/).

<img src="thingspeak.png" width="540"/>

### Receiving your data from TTN with an HTTP Web service
The TTN LoRaWAN backend offers a Webhook based [HTTP integration](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/http/).

### Subscribing to data from TTN with an MQTT client
The TTN LoRaWAN backend is also an [MQTT broker](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/mqtt/api.html).

This means you can read your data with any MQTT client library.

Consider using these MQTT client libraries for [Go](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/golang/), [Java](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/java/), [Node.js](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/nodejs/) or [Python](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/python/).

* To get uplink packets from a device:
```
$ mqtt sub -t "<AppID>/devices/<DevID>/up" \
-h "eu.thethings.network" -u "<AppID>" \
-P "<AppAccessKey>" # see TTN console, apps
```
* To send a packet downlink, Base64 encoded:
```
$ mqtt pub -t "<AppID>/devices/<DevID>/down" \
-m '{"port":1,"payload_raw":"<Bytes>"}' -h …
```

### Hosting on virtual machines
To host your own code during #MakeZurich, get a free Linux virtual machine (VM) from [Datacenter Light](https://datacenterlight.ch/).

Contact [support@ungleich.ch](mailto:support@ungleich.ch) with the subject *MakeZurich VM* and specify what you need:

CPU cores (1..8), RAM size (1..16) GB, SSD size (10..50) GB and native IPv4 (yes/no).

## 3rd-party services
3rd-party services allow to store or display data, and add logic "in the cloud".

### Dweet.io
[Dweet.io](http://dweet.io/) is a simple storage service for name/value pairs.

* Host: dweet.io
* Port: 443
* POST /dweet/for/THING_NAME?NAME=VALUE
* POST /dweet/for/THING_NAME?NAME=VALUE&NAME2=VALUE2
* GET /get/latest/dweet/for/THING_NAME
* GET /get/dweets/for/THING_NAME

### IFTTT
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) is a rule-based service to integrate connected products.

* https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks

### Node-RED
[Node-RED](https://nodered.org) is a flow-based development tool for visual programming.

* Host: LOCAL_IP (e.g. on your Laptop or a Raspberry Pi)
* Port: 1880
* https://nodered.org/docs/
* https://cookbook.nodered.org/ (e.g. [mqtt](https://cookbook.nodered.org/mqtt/) or [http](https://cookbook.nodered.org/http/))

* GET /channels/CHANNEL_ID/feed.json?api_key=READ_API_KEY 

## Client
The client is usually a Web browser, an [Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/slices/getting-started) app or an [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/) app.

Or, an Internet-connected device like a Raspberry Pi or an ESP8266 device acts as a client.

## Tools
### cURL
[cURL](https://curl.haxx.se) is a great command line (CLI) HTTP client.

Use cURL to debug Web API calls.

* Install cURL via https://curl.haxx.se > Download
* Send a GET request:
```
$ curl -v tmb.gr/hello.html
```
* Send a POST request with a text body:
```
$ curl -v --data 't=23' https://postb.in/...
```
* Send a POST request with a JSON body:
```
$ curl -v -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"t":23}' https://postb.in/...
```
* Send a PUT request:
```
$ curl -vX PUT --data 'hello' https://postb.in/...
```
* For details, see https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manual.html and https://curl.haxx.se/book.html

### Postbin
[Postbin](https://postb.in/) is a Web based tool to debug Webhook calls.

* Visit [https://postb.in/](https://postb.in/) to create a new (temporary) *bin*
* Send a Web request to the displayed URL, e.g. with [cURL](#cURL)
* Refresh the *bin* Web page to see incoming Web requests

### MQTT.js
[MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs) comes with a command line (CLI) MQTT client.

Use the *mqtt* tool to debug MQTT API calls.

* Install MQTT.js CLI from https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js or
```
$ sudo npm install mqtt -g
```
* Publish a message to a topic:
```
$ mqtt pub -t 'mytopic' -h 'test.mosquitto.org' -m 'Hello, world!'
```
* Subscribe to a topic:
```
$ mqtt sub -t 'mytopic' -h 'test.mosquitto.org'
```
